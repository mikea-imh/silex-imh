    <p>InMotion does not offer unlimited data transfer. We understand the appeal of such an offering, but decide not to choose it because we understand that it is indeed a misleading claim.</p>

    <p>Instead, we set limits to protect each of our customers from being affected by abuses from a few individuals.</p>

    <h2>Unlimited Offerings</h2>

    <p>While we don't offer unlimited data transfer, we do give all of our customers a slew of other unlimited features to help you manage your server and customers.</p>
