<h1>Unlimited Dedicated Server Features &amp; Support</h1>
<p class="intro"></p>
<p>InMotion does not offer unlimited data transfer. We understand the appeal of such an offering, but decide not to choose it because we understand that it is indeed a misleading claim.</p>
<p>Instead, we set limits to protect each of our customers from being affected by abuses from a few individuals.</p>

<h2>Unlimited Offerings</h2>
<p>While we don't offer unlimited data transfer, we do give all of our customers a slew of other unlimited features to help you manage your server and customers.</p>
