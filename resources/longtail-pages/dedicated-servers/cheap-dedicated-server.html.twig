        <p>While researching different hosting solutions, you realize that an inexpensive, affordable and cheap dedicated server package is what you need. But when comparing different plans, what stands out the most are the prices which can range anywhere from $150 to $800 or more a month!</p>
        <p>So what is the <a href="/dedicated_servers/articles/dedicated-server-price.html">best choice for you</a>?</p>
        <p>That depends. You can purchase a dedicated server that on paper is very impressive. But when something goes wrong and it comes time to talk to a support tech, they leave you hanging. At InMotion Hosting, not only do you get a great machine, but also the support that you need to keep your website running.</p>

Our machines are not made up of random parts mated together just to boost specs. We have carefully chosen each component to maximize performance.</td>
                <td>CentOS is our operating system of choice. We do this because CentOS built specifically for web servers. Best of all, it is offered as a free operating system which lets us pass the savings to you. This is how we are able to offer a cheaper dedicated hosting alternative to our competitors.</td>
                <td>Our Systems Support Representatives are experienced in creating websites, database management, programming, or hacking their machines for fun. We hire these types because we believe that every background is unique and can bring to the team the type of expertise needed to help solve the most complex issues.</td>
