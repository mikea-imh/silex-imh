        <p>Reading Drupal hosting reviews is a great way to get a behind the scenes look at a potential web hosting provider. Customer reviews can be very helpful as they come from someone with firsthand experience using the hosting service you're interested in subscribing to.</p>

                        <p>I just wanted to let you guys know that Jeremy K really saved my bacon with this solution, I'd been scratching my head over it for a few days now and, since I'm not a web dev, really couldn't sort it. The response time on my support request was fantastic, make sure you give this guy a raise!</p>
                        <p>Kind regards,<br />
