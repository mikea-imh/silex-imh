        <h2>Terms of Service/Usage Policy</h2>
        <p>InMotion Hostingâ„¢ Acceptable Use Policy described below defines the actions which IMH considers to be abused and strictly prohibited. There are no exclusions in this listing. Please, be aware that the actions listed below are also prohibited from other Internet Presence Providers (IPP's) and their users on behalf of IMH to advertise any service hosted by IMH or connected via the IMH Network. As defined by the Federal Trade Commission Deception Policy Statement, such services are not to be advertised by way of deceptive marketing policies. For abbreviation purposes, InMotion Hosting will be referred as IMH and companies or individual account owners using our services as CUSTOMERS.</p><p>IMH Acceptable Use Policy has been formulated with the following goals in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure security, reliability and privacy of IMH systems and network, and the networks and systems of others.</li>
            <li>Avoid situations that may cause IMH to incur civil liability.</li>
            <li>Maintain the image and reputation of IMH as a responsible organization.</li>
            <li>Preserve the value of Internet resources as a conduit for free expression.</li>
            <li>Encourage the responsible use of net resources, discouraging practices which degrade the usability of network resources and thus the value of Internet services.</li>
            <li>Preserve the privacy and security of individual users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Acceptable Use Policy below defines the actions which IMH considers to be abusive, and thus, strictly prohibited. The examples named in this list are non-exclusive, and are provided solely for guidance to IMH customers. If you are unsure whether any contemplated use or action is permitted, please send mail to abuse@InMotionHosting.com and we will assist you. Please note that the actions listed below are also not permitted from other Internet Service Providers on behalf of, or to advertise, any service hosted by IMH, or connected via the IMH network. Furthermore, such services may not be advertised via deceptive marketing policies, as defined by the Federal Trade Commission Deception Policy Statement.</p>
        <h4>Unlimited Disk Space &amp; Bandwidth</h4>
        <p>While IMH does not meter disk space &amp; bandwidth, the purpose of an IMH hosting account is to host web sites. Using a hosting account primarily for online file storage or archiving electronic files is prohibited.</p><p>IMH Personal &amp; Business Class hosting are shared hosting environments, so to ensure fast &amp; reliable service to all of our clients, accounts that adversely affect server or network performance must correct these issues or will be asked to upgrade to a virtual or dedicated server.</p>
        <h4>Free Domain Name</h4>
        <p>Your web hosting account includes a free domain registration or transfer for the first year of service. When your web hosting account renews, the applicable then-current pricing will be applied to your account (currently domain registration is $11.95/year).</p>
        <h4>Student Web Hosting</h4>
        <p>Discounts for students, educators and school administration are available for new customers only. Any customer who purchases through our Education Program is eligible to renew their hosting for one additional term at the same price. After that, renewals will occur at the standard fee for that package. Domain names are not included with any Education Program package but may be purchased separately.</p><p>Proof of enrollment or employment at an educational institution is required in order to purchase through InMotion Hosting's Education Program. An educational institution is defined as a primary school, middle school, high school, junior college, college or university. For profit educational institutions and tutoring services are not included in this offer. A complimentary shared (Power package) web hosting account may be provided to teachers, professors or administrators on an as needed basis for evaluation. We reserve the right to revoke or cancel complimentary accounts at any time.</p>
        <h4>Network Security</h4>
        <p>Customers may not use IMH's network as to attempt to circumvent user authentication or security of any host, network, or account. This includes, but is not limited to, accessing data not intended for the Customer, logging into a server or account the Customer is not expressly authorized to access, password cracking, probing the security of other networks in search of weakness, or violation of any other organization's security policy. </p>Customers may not attempt to interfere or deny service to any user, host, or network. This includes, but is not limited to, flooding, mailbombing, or other deliberate attempts to overload or crash a host or network.<p>Customers will be held liable for incorrect setting of netmasks, routes, or any other network configuration or programming issue which causes unnecessary broadcast or multicast traffic on our network, or denial of service, deliberate or not, caused by forging ARP queries or replies or by configuring IPs into their machine which were not assigned to their server. Any of these actions may result in disconnection of the server at fault from the network and/or correction of the fault at the customer's risk and expense. Any loss of functionality caused by the attempted correction of the problem will be the customer's responsibility to solve. If the malignity of the problem is deemed by InMotion Hosting to not warrant such drastic action, the customer will be contacted via the ticketing system to correct the problem himself. Customers are responsible for maintaining their contact information in the ticketing system such that the email address is always reachable even in the event of their InMotion Hosting servers being shut down.</p><p>If your server is the initiator or target of a denial of service attack that adversely affects our/somebody else network, we will terminate your account without warning and you will be held responsible for any charges that may result from this action.</p><p>Activities that attract denial of service attacks are expressly prohibited. Customers involved in these activities will be terminated as soon as we are aware of them. These activities include, but are not limited to: selling shell accounts, and involvement with IRC of any kind. This prohibition is for the protection of our customer base as a whole; these kinds of services tend to attract attacks that have the potential to degrade service for all of our customers.</p><p>IMH will cooperate fully with investigations of violations of systems or network security at other sites, including cooperating with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of suspected criminal violations. Users who violate systems or network security may incur criminal or civil liability. InMotion Hosting reserves the right to charge up to $500 per complaint to investigate.</p>
        <h4>Mandatory Security Updates</h4>
        <p>From time-to-time, we notify our clients of any exploit we deem potentially catastrophic. For an exploit to be considered catastrophic, it must be attacking widely deployed applications that are in use on a majority of servers. For example, but not limited to, software related to DNS, APACHE, and SENDMAIL.</p><p>The security notification will be sent via our customer subscribed mailing list, with a subject line of "Mandatory Security Update". It will provide a synopsis of the exploit, what is effected, and probable repercussions associated with failure to update. In addition, the email will provide a link for customers to download updated software or fixes, or patches, and directions on installing it. Customers are responsible for following the instructions in all " Mandatory Security Update" within 24 hours from their release.</p><p>To ensure the security of the clients' servers and to maintain our network integrity, if 24 hours past notification the software at issue has not been updated or patched, InMotion Hosting reserves the right to apply all necessary updates, fix any other obvious security holes we may find, and bill the customer's account at the applicable hourly support rate without further notice or customer approval.</p>
        <h4>Server Interface</h4>
        <p>The InMotion Hosting Web Interface and Control Panel are proprietary software, a single Perl script at /usr/local/sbin/interface. Although we do not protect the software with compilation nor with encryption, it is protected under copyright and trade secret laws and is not to be modified nor distributed in any fashion unless authorized in writing by InMotion Hosting. Under no circumstances will we allow changes to the Copyright notice and/or disclaimers on version 2 of the interface (revisions 1.110 and above), since the "Server Interface" Trade Name and logo are already protecting resellers from references to InMotion Hosting.</p><p>Requests for modification, including translating into other languages, addition of links or advertising, changes to menus, or customer-specific options, must be sent to sales@InMotion Hosting.com and are subject to an approval process by all departments. In general, the only changes approved are those of a general nature, representing an increase in functionality for all customers. Changes for a single customer which would cause more than one concurrent version of the software will not be considered.</p><p>Changes which are approved will be done on a prioritized basis by InMotion Hosting technical staff. Expedited processing of a change order can be paid for by a customer, but the changes remain property of InMotion Hosting and may be given to other customers.</p>
        <h4>Customer spamming policy</h4>
        <p>InMotion Hosting has zero tolerance for spam originating from our customers, or from our customers' customers, or for spam advertising web sites of our customers or our customers' customers.</p>
        <h4>The Policy</h4>
        <p>You refers to the InMotion Hosting Customer; we refers to InMotion Hosting.</p>
        <p>InMotion Hosting has the right to charge $500 per complaint to investigate.</p>
        <p>InMotion Hosting does not deal with your customers or their customers etc.; We hold our customers responsible for dealing with spam from or about their section of the network. InMotion Hosting customers are responsible for ensuring that they, their customers, and their respective agents and contractors abide by this policy. InMotion Hosting's customers will be held responsible for all traffic either sent via their connection to InMotion Hosting or sent elsewhere using support services provided via their connection to InMotion Hosting. "Support services" includes DNS, hosting websites, electronic mailboxes, IRC servers, sale of spamming software or other similar services. Customers are also responsible for ensuring that they do not advertise or promote themselves through UBE/UCE.</p>
        <p>If we get a first complaint, we will forward it to you. If we don't receive a response indicating the complete resolution of the complaint within 24 hours, we may drop the section of IP space involved in the spam complaint until we are convinced that the problem is resolved. In particular, we are concerned with spam that not only originates from your network, but also that advertises sites hosted on your network.</p>
        <p>If we get repeat complaints and it is clear that the problem has not been resolved, we may blackhole the section of IP space involved in the spam complaint until we are convinced that the problem is resolved. If so, we will contact you as soon as is feasible.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right, to drop the section of IP space involved in spam or Denial-of-Service complaints if it is clear that the offending activity is causing great harm to parties on the Internet. In particular, if open relays are on your network or a customer's network, or if denial of service attacks are originating from your network. In certain rare cases, we may have to do this before attempting to contact you. If we do this, we will contact you as soon as is feasible.</p>
        <b>What does this mean to me?</b>
        <p>You must provide us with, and keep current, good contact information for you. E-mail, fax, and telephone contacts are used, in that order of preference.</p>
        <p>You must educate your customers about spam so that it does not become a problem for you, or for us. If you sell accounts on your system(s), you must provide an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) at least as restrictive as our own.</p>
        <p>You must promptly investigate and deal with any spam or other abuse complaints forwarded to you.</p>
        <p>If your server hosts any mailing lists, they must all be true opt-in lists, which means that, before sending any commercial email, a confirmation email, preferably with a tracking number, is sent to the new subscriber, to which they must respond. If they do not respond to the confirmation email, they must not be considered to have opted in. You should keep these confirmations on file or in a database so that when complaints come in, you can prove the subscriber actually opted in. You must in addition provide at least one easy way to opt-out: see the MAPS guidelines for details.</p>
        <p>If your server is used to send any email at all, it must also be configured to support RFC 1123 section 5.2; in particular it must accept mail for 'postmaster' and must accept bounces (which have a FROM address of <>).</p>
        <b>Why this Policy?</b>
        <p>We at InMotion Hosting feel strongly that the usability of the Internet is dependent on the elimination of UCE (Unsolicited Commercial E-mail) from the mailboxes and newsgroups of both casual and heavy Internet users. If you host web sites, you must be particularly vigilant, as you and your other customers could be disconnected from the Internet due to one customer's spamming.</p>
        <h4>Data Backup</h4>
        <p>InMotion Hosting maintains, as a convenience to its clients, regular automated data backups on accounts equal to or less than 10 gigabytes in total size. This service is included only with Business Class or Virtual Private Server hosting accounts and is provided at no additional charge. Hosting accounts greater than 10 gigabytes in size will not be included in regular data backups; this service is, however, available for an additional service charge for accounts exceeding the 10 gigabyte size limit.</p><p>While InMotion Hosting maintains the previously stated backups, this service is provided as a convenience only and InMotion Hosting assumes no liability as to the availability or completeness of client data backups. Each client is expected and encouraged to maintain backup copies of their own data. InMotion Hosting will provide, upon request, one (1) data restore per four (4) calendar months free of charge. Additional data restores may be provided but are subject to additional service fees.</p>
        <h4>Bandwidth Charges</h4>
        <p>Higher levels of traffic will incur overcharges on a monthly basis. However, the rates for bandwidth usage are lower for IMH than for any other services we offer. IMH provides full access to web reports for network traffic monitoring and reporting. IMH also provides graphs that show customers' monthly usage, which is the average rate, and reflects the amount of bandwidth transferred during the month. The bandwidth charges reflects the average monthly bandwidth in Kilobits per second (Kbps) and in Gb/month. These charges reflect our expenses in network maintenance, upgrades, backbone port charges, leased line loops, and equipment.</p>
        <h4>IP Policy</h4>
        <p> ARIN (the American Registry for Internet Numbers) is becoming very stringent with IP addresses, and refuses to grant them without a strict accounting of use of existing IP's; we must therefore require periodic updates of IP address use. The way we will implement this, for now, is for customers who need more IP addresses to send a blank email to reverse@InMotion Hosting.com to get detailed instructions via autoresponder.</p><p>Any IP numbers which remain unused after a 30-day period, according to our periodic 'ping' testing, will be subject to reassignment by InMotion Hosting. No prior notice will be given, but we will email you at your current contact address to inform you that we have taken back the IP numbers. You can of course request more when you are ready to use them. And, as stipulated elsewhere, any work incurred in reclaiming unused IP numbers which have been registered as nameservers will be billed at our current administrative services rates.</p><p>While we will allocate our customers an "unlimited" number of IP addresses, our allocation of IP addresses is limited by ARIN's new policies. These new policies state that use of IP addresses for IP based virtual hosts will not be accepted as justification for new IP addresses. What this means to you is that you MUST use name-based hosting where possible. We will periodically review IP address usage, and if we find that clients are using IP addresses where name-based hosting could be used, we will revoke authorization to use those IP addresses that could be used with name-based hosting."</p>
        <p>InMotion Hosting may assign its customers IP (Internet Protocol) addresses on a temporary basis or for the life of the contract. Customer agrees that IP addresses are not portable, and acknowledges that IP addresses are the sole property of InMotion Hosting and are assigned as part of the services. Furthermore, client acknowledges that use of IP addresses not allocated by InMotion Hosting to customer or users is expressively prohibited and will incur a penalty fee.</p>
        <p>This fee would be calculated on a standard engineers hourly rate fee of $150 separate from any other service or incident fees prepaid by customer. At the conclusion of Customer's contract, Customer is required to provide a copy of an Authorized domain registrar (i.e. Network Solutions) records, showing that Customer's hostname servers no longer claim the use of our IP addressed we have provided to customer. This document must be delivered to InMotion Hosting within 10 days after the effective contract termination date.</p>
        <h4>General Conduct</h4>
        <p>Customers are prohibited from transmitting on or through any of IMH's services, any material that is, in IMH's sole discretion, unlawful, obscene, threatening, abusive, libelous, or encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any local, state, national or international law.</p>
        <p>IMH's services may only be used for lawful purposes. Transmission, distribution, or storage of any information, data or material in violation of United States or state regulation or law, or by the common law, is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or any other statute. IMH's reserves the right to remove such illegal material from its servers.</p>
        <p>The customer is responsible for keeping his billing data with IMH up-to-date and accurate. Furnishing false data on any contract or application, including fraudulent use of credit card numbers, is grounds for immediate termination, and may subject the offender to civil or criminal liability.</p>
        <p>The resale of IMH's products and services is not permitted, unless specifically permitted and documented in a written agreement.</p>
        <p>Important IP Disclosure: InMotion Hosting may assign customer a reasonable amount of IP addresses (Internet Protocol) on a temporary basis or for the life of the contract. Client agrees that IP addresses are not portable and acknowledges that IP addresses are the sole property of InMotion Hosting and are assigned as part of the services. Furthermore, client acknowledges that use of IP addresses not allocated by InMotion Hosting to customer or users is expressively prohibited and will incur a penalty fee.This fee would be calculated on a standard engineers hourly rate fee of $150 separate from any other service or incident fees prepaid by customer.</p>
        <p>Facilitating a violation of this AUP: Software, services, programs, activities, and advertisements that promote, enable, or facilitate any activity that is prohibited within this document, including spam, denial of service attacks, compromise of other systems or attempts to compromise other systems are ALL considered to be violations of this AUP.</p>
        <p>To insure the quality of service of our shared hosting clients, InMotion Hosting reserves the right to migrate high resource utilizing clients to servers which may, or may not, incorporate stated 'business class hardware'.</p>
