            <td><p>The great thing about a VPS over shared hosting is the ability to manage the server how you want to. Whether it is modifying server files, managing domains, or monitoring server performance, you can truly see how your server is performing.</p></td>
            <td><p>If you plan on having a lot of customers and they need some freedom to manage their servers by themselves, then a VPS lets you do this. You can create individual cPanel accounts so that they can manage their emails, create FTP accounts, and let them see for themselves how their website is performing.</p>
            <p>This will save you time from not having to micromanage all of your customers websites.</p>
