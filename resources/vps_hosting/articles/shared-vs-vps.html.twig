    <p>When looking for hosting, finding the right solution for you can be difficult. Looking at server specs, features, and pricing can be a bit overwhelming. Below are lists of the pros and cons of shared and VPS hosting.</p>
    <h3>The Pros &amp; Cons of Shared Hosting</h3>
    <table class="article">
        <tr>
            <th width="50%">
                Pro
            </th width="50%">
            <th>
                Con
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <li><p>Cheaper</p></li>
                <li><p>Fully managed</p></li>
                <li><p>Requires less knowledge about hosting</p></li>
            </td>
            <td>
                <li><p>Limited access to the server.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cannot customize the server match needs.</p></li>
                <li><p>Normally, hardware specs are slower. Abuse by one user can greatly affect performance on other users.</p></li>
                <li><p>Limited set of features such as total number of databases, number of ftp accounts, and how many sites can be hosted.</p></li>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>The Pros &amp; Cons of VPS Hosting</h3>
    <table class="article">
        <tr>
            <th width="50%">
                Pro
            </th width="50%">
            <th>
                Con
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <li><p>You can fully manage your server. This means customizing it to your needs.</p></li>
                <li><p>VPS's are generally placed on faster, higher end machines. More RAM and CPU power gives your websites or applications a fast and stable environment to live.</p></li>
                <li><p>Unlimited number of databases, FTP account, and even cPanel accounts for your customers.</p></li>
            </td>
            <td>
                <li>
                    <p>More expensive than shared hosting.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Although the server specs are increased, you are still sharing a machine with other accounts. As with shared hosting, abuse by one customer can affect all the others on the machine as well.</p></li>
            </td>
