    <p>Pricing for VPS servers can vary greatly. The differences in pricing is the result of getting more features, increased hardware specs, and level of support.</p>

    <h3>More Features</h3>
    <p>If you are looking to upgrade from a Shared Hosting account, you will notice an increase of certain features. These include number of allowed MYSQL databases and sites on 1 account.</p>

    <p>So what does this mean for you?</p>

    <p>It means that you can have as many websites on your hosting account that you would like. With unlimited databases, it also means that you can build these websites using any CMS system that requires a database. With a VPS, the possibilities are endless.</p>

                <p>Shared hosting accounts offer a very limited hardware abilities. Those types of servers are meant to handle a very limited number of websites per hosting account. But once you get into VPS, disk space volume and performance becomes an issue. Also, the hardware increases specifications in RAM and processing power.</p>

                <p>The level of support needed with a VPS requires more knowledge than managing a VPS account. With a VPS, since our customers get optional root access, can SSH into their servers, and have access to cPanel and Web Hosting Manager, the support level greatly increases.</p>

                <p>These factors help influence the pricing of VPS servers. At InMotion, with every VPS package, you get reliable Dell hardware, 24/7 customer service, and access to a suite of products that InMotion includes for free (cPanel &amp; Web Hosting Manager).</p>
