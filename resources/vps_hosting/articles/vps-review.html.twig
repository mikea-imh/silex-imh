    <h2>Which VPS Plan Is Right For You?</h2>

    <h3>VPS-1000</h3>

    <p>For those who are jumping into a VPS from shared hosting, this may be the best option. It is an affordable solution for those looking to learn how to use cPanel, utilize the command line, and possibly becoming a reseller for less intensive clients.</p>

    <h3>VPS-2000</h3>

    <p>InMotion's most popular package, the VPS-2000 gives increased performance boost in RAM and data transfer limits. This plan is best suited for those who are running more CPU intensive tasks, multiple CMS software installations, and those who are reselling hosting to more advanced users.</p>

    <h3>VPS-3000</h3>

    <p>The high performing VPS-3000 package has all the specs a power user needs before going to a dedicated server. A great solution for large enterprises that run multiple large databases, host files, and needs to serve this to their employees and customers.</p>

    <p>This is also suited for the developer looking to create a high-end application that requires high CPU cycles and multiple processing.</p>
