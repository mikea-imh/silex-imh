            <li><p>VPS's are generally placed on faster, higher end machines. More RAM and CPU power gives your websites or applications a fast and stable environment to live.</p></li>
            <li><p>Unlimited number of databases, FTP account, and even cPanel accounts for your customers.</p></li>
        </td>
        <td>
            <li><p>Although the server specs are increased, you are still sharing a machine with other accounts. As with shared hosting, abuse by one customer can affect all the others on the machine as well.</p></li>

                <p>It is possible to add on hardware to increase your server specs. Need more RAM or hard drives? Adding those are all possible with a dedicated server.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Since the owner has a lot more control, there is limited help from tech support. Support would just be limited to hardware and network issues. Basic troubleshooting of scripts may be possible. But the more complex the site or issue, the less likely tech support can help.</p>
